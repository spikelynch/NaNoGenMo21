## Farbenlehre

Synaesthetic concrete poetry with source text Goethe's colour theory

- train an RNN on the Gutenberg text
- modify the RNN sampler to allow lipogram generation
- map letters to RGB values according to my synaesthesia
- rasterised lipogram - take an image and generate text such that each part of the printed text is "coloured" according to the RGB -> letter mapping
