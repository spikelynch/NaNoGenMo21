 The appearances are also in its parallactic acid, and a yellow-red appears 
in a very similar attained by the authority a similar cases are always a abstance, 
 a somewhat light image is always assumed to accident, and at the time in a 
very readily acquainted with the apparatus in a higher sea-gies, 1111. The apparatus 
in a very air and accudually indispensably; it appears alluded to a yellowish

of the Venetian practice with a reddish yellowish, and although Bassany, it 
is to be observed that a distinctness which are always a variety of time in

a very different degrees, and although Bassany in a variety of air. Air analysis 
of a variety of forms, and by a shining circle, and all it is almost advantageous, 
the very vivid colour vanishes arranged on a black sire, and are in a very air 
whole length. The former is covered with a view to a light yellow, and yellow-red 
be a very reverend, for it is also investigated by a coloured appearance in 
the province of the Venetian painters, each singly, as a coloured appearance 
which is investigated with the division of the apparatus in an atomic in a balloon 
of the Venetian painters, even an impression of a whole with a yellowish appearance.

 In conclusion we may convince ourselves in some degree and aived at a dark 
object than any vehicle vivid and blue-red, as it were, a somewhat layging a 
very vivid and splendid appearances produces a blue-red appearance.

 The very vivid colour of the Venetian painters, in this state, and all that

 If we look on a large object formed, and so decided and varied before vivid

vividualised by some coloured accordingly, as loct in convey invite our attention 
to the light proceeds upwardly green, and lastly clearly evident to a very remarkable 
appearance of colour as a lucidly classed blue or colourless. Blue or blue is 
very nearly allied to the light colour callly because the colours of the surface

 The colour of the colourless surface only that last class of colours, but even

 Lastly, the light appeared a yellow and yellow-red appears as a yellowing and

 THE FORTLICATION TO RED. 

 The treatise of Aristotle's reddish directions, thus described it to be remarked 
 that the direct reflection of the direction of the direction of the thin theory 
the colours of the prism, are usually surrounding round the surface of the thin 
colour is possible with reference to the direct reflexes, to the dark surface, 
the luminous portions of the prism, are usually drupriduded by a straight line 
to the translation of the prism, through which the surprising represent them.

 The duration of colours usually dryss, are undurably produced by the direction 
 it is to be represented portions or durable principles. 

 222. 

 The principle of the prism are prepared from the prism. In prismatic experiments 
at the same time produced upon authorities are reluctantly distinguished from 
the truth of the red-ring." Spreading drawing, and produces the prism through 
the two surfaces are suppredium preduded to arrest, where the direction of the 
thin colour appears durable elovers are produced by uspredium or polightelists. 
 This process of durability of producing the direction of the double shadows 
that blue appears rubrured by preparing a dreward of plants. 

 The two last condition.--If a purple during the duration of the time the futterate 
transparent mediums, the red did in the productions of the coloured according 
to the attention of the truth of the duration of the physiologists of the thin 
colour is to be therefore to produce the red colour of the two strongly to the 
 term (late) appears to us reduced to the dark room, and the strong ground to 
the two fluids to the rivals contradict to produce the translation to the light

But we make the embryom may be made with the physiological contrast to the time

## Appendix
_Colourless Light_ is an attempt to use my own grapheme-colour synaesthesia to modulate the output of a recurrent neural network so that the distribution of letters on the page forms a pattern. I've always had strong one-way associations between letters, numbers and colours - the glyphs evoke colours, but the colours don't evoke glyphs - and I have a taste for lipograms, texts which avoid certain letters, the most famous of which is Georges Perec's novel _La Disparition_, translated into English as _A Void_ by Gilbert Adair, and one of the things which strikes me about them is that they are different colour, in the synaesthetic sense, from a normal text. The letter E, for me, is a strong, bright red, and most of the contribution to a word's synaesthetic hue comes from its vowels, so when I read Perec's novel, the vowel colours from A (white), I (transparent), O (black) and U (deep purple), make the text seem different: darker, less saturated, closer to the blue end of the spectrum.

I've been tinkering with lipogrammatic RNNs for a while now - for a recent experiment see [gravidum cor](https://bots.mikelynch.org/gravidum_cor/), a Mastodon bot which generates a simulation of Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy without E. What I wanted to do for this year's NaNoGenMo was make an RNN generate text with a different mixture of letters on different parts of the page. I had no idea how this would look to my synaesthetic sense - whether the invisible colours of the letters would translate when arranged spatially in this way.

At first I had the idea that one could take an image and map its RGB components onto the appropriate letters and make a "picture", but my early experiments with rendering two different constrained outputs into a checkerboard proved that patterns on a scale of ten or so letters weren't really detectable. I settled on using two large-scale patterns: dividing the page into two halves along a diagonal, and placing a circle of one colour on a background of another. The colour combinations are chosen by an algorithm which moves through every combination of the eight basic colours in turn, ensuring that each combination of two colours is rendered with each of the geometrical patterns.

I found that my initial idea of rendering different colours by suppressing letters didn't work very well. If I suppressed all letters other than those which look red to me (E, J, S and 3) the resulting output was too constrained to make sense. I tried another strategy, of trying to make red text by suppressing the letters and numbers which are complementary to it, but this didn't produce results which looked red. Many samples of experiments in this vein can be found [in the outputs/suppresssion/ folder in the repository](https://github.com/spikelynch/NaNoGenMo21/tree/main/output/suppression).

So, rather than suppressing letters, I modified the RNN to increase the probability of the relevant letter set. Using [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation) as a starting point, I modified the part of the one-step sampler which masks out error characters to boost the probability of a particular set of glyphs: here is an example of text with E, J, S and 3 (and their lower-case counterparts) boosted:

See sees. "everything sees these experiments essees in semi-transparents
meetes seems sees in some sees essential to each other seems to see sees these
seconds essentially seess, these spectra messessed seen these exerspessing
substances see yellow
```

The patterns were implemented by defining a function which takes an x, y pair defining the location on the page, and returns a set of character weights which will generate the correct colour for that point. The book is rendered in a monospaced font as a shortcut: theoretically it would be possible to calculate the location of each letter in a proportional-width font as it was rendered, but this would have involved too much intertwining of the text generation and the typesetting. I quite liked the default monospace font chosen by Pandoc, with its faint aroma of computer journals and concrete poetry anthologies from the seventies, but it doesn't include enough Unicode to render the Greek letters which the RNN occasionally generates, so I used DejaVu Sans Mono instead.

The RNN was trained on [the Gutenberg edition Goethe's Theory of Colour in Charles Lock Eastlake's translation](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/50572/pg50572-images.html), both because it generates an appropriately colour-obsessed text, and because of Goethe's importance in the history of the philosophy of colour. Goethe was the defender of a notion of colour based on phenomenology and affect, in defiance of the scientific consensus following Newton. The colours of synaesthesia, whether they arise from childhood associations or some cross-wiring of sensory modalities on the individual brain, fall more on Goethe's side of this debate.

Finally, although my initial idea that a fine-grained colour map could be used to produce a detailed image via a black and white text didn't work, I can report that the pages of _Colourless Light_ do seem to me to be coloured, in the curious indirect way in which grapheme synaesthesia works. It's never as if the characters themselves are coloured: the colour seems to be on some other plane. But looking at these pages is as close as I've felt to being able to see my own synaesthesia. It's even more solipsistic an exercise than NaNoGenMo usually is: you will be able to notice the different letter distributions, but even if you also have grapheme synaesthesia, you won't see the same colours as I do. Of course, you can edit [the config file](https://github.com/spikelynch/NaNoGenMo21/tree/main/config.json), and generate your own.

### Instructions

You'll need to install TensorFlow and PyYAML, and put the [trained checkpoint files](https://etc.mikelynch.org/nanogenmo2021/) in the directory `./trained_checkpoints/goethe`.

The script to generate the novel as markdown is:

```
% python ./farbenlehre.py -o myversion -n goethe -c config.json
```

The PDF version was generated with Pandoc:

```
pandoc --pdf-engine=xelatex -o output/myversion/colourless_light.pdf \
